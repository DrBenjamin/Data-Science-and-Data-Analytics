# Scope and Nature of Data Science

xy

## Defining Data Science as an Academic Discipline

Data science draws from and interacts with multiple foundational disciplines:
* Informatics / Information Systems
* Computer Science (algorithms, data structures, systems design)
* Mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, optimization)
* Statistics & Econometrics (inference, modeling, causal analysis)
* Social Science & Behavioral Sciences (contextual interpretation, experimental design)

## Significance of Business Data Analysis for Decision-Making

* Supports evidence-based strategic, tactical, and operational decisions.
* Reduces uncertainty in forecasting, pricing, resource allocation, and risk management.
* Enables performance measurement and continuous improvement.
* Facilitates customer understanding, personalization, and retention strategies.

## Emerging Trends

Key technological and methodological developments shaping the data landscape:
* Evolution of computing and data processing architectures.
* Digitalization of processes and platforms.
* Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL).
* Big Data ecosystems (volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value).
* Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-driven data generation.
* Cloud computing and elastic infrastructure.
* Blockchain for distributed trust and data integrity.
* Industry 4.0: cyber-physical systems and automation.
* Remote and hybrid working environments: collaboration, distributed analytics, governance.

## Types of Analytics

* Descriptive Analytics: What happened?
* Predictive Analytics: What is likely to happen?
* Prescriptive Analytics: What should we do?

# Data Analytic Competencies

xy

## Types of Data

* Cross-sectional data
* Panel (longitudinal) data
* Time-series data
* Geo-referenced / spatial data
* (Potentially) streaming / real-time data

## Types of Variables

* Continuous (interval/ratio)
* Count
* Ordinal
* Categorical (nominal / binary)
* (Possibly) compositional or hierarchical structures

## Conceptual Framework: Knowledge & Understanding of Data

* Clarify analytical purpose and domain context.
* Define entities, observational units, and identifiers.
* Align business concepts with data structures.

## Data Collection

Data collection is a fundamental competency in data science that encompasses the systematic gathering of information from various sources to support analytical objectives [@etinkaya-Rundel2021]. The quality and appropriateness of collected data directly influence the validity and reliability of subsequent analyses.

![Data Collection Methods](./topics/Data%20Analytic%20Competencies/Data%20Collection/Method_of_data_collection.jpg)

### Core Data Collection Principles

* **Source Identification**: Identify internal and external sources based on analytical requirements.
* **Acquisition Methods**: Acquire via APIs, databases, surveys, sensors, or third-party vendors.
* **Quality Assessment**: Assess provenance, licensing, and ethical considerations.
* **Methodological Rigor**: Apply systematic approaches to ensure data representativeness and minimize bias.

### Data Collection Competencies

Effective data collection requires competencies across multiple dimensions including technical proficiency, methodological understanding, and ethical awareness. Organizations must develop comprehensive frameworks for data collection that align with their analytical objectives while maintaining data quality standards.

For detailed methodologies and best practices, refer to established [data collection research frameworks](https://researchmethodology.org/data-collection/) and the accompanying [Data Collection Competencies](./topics/Data%20Analytic%20Competencies/Data%20Collection/Data%20Collection%20Competencies.pdf) documentation.

## Data Management
* Organize: schema design, naming conventions.
* Clean: resolve duplicates, inconsistencies, missingness.
* Convert: type casting, normalization, encoding.
* Curate: maintain lineage, documentation, metadata.
* Preserve: backups, versioning, retention policies.

## Data Evaluation

* Plan analyses aligned with objectives and stakeholders.
* Conduct exploratory, inferential, and predictive procedures appropriately.
* Evaluate robustness, reliability, and validity.
* Assess limitations, bias, and ethical impact.

# Applications in the Programming Language R

xy

## Core tidyverse Tooling

Explore fundamental packages:
* `dplyr` for data manipulation (filter, mutate, summarise, joins).
* `tidyr` for data reshaping (pivoting, nesting, separating, unnesting).
* `ggplot2` for layered grammar-based visualization.
* (Optionally) `readr`, `purrr`, `stringr`, `forcats` for ingestion, functional iteration, text, and factor handling.

## Data Visualization Principles

* Choose encodings appropriate to variable types.
* Emphasize clarity: reduce chart junk; apply perceptual best practices.
* Support comparison, trend detection, and anomaly spotting.

## Detecting Outliers and Anomalies

* Rule-based methods (IQR, z-scores).
* Robust statistics (median, MAD).
* Model-based or multivariate detection (e.g., Mahalanobis distance, clustering residuals).
* Distinguish errors vs. novel but valid observations.

## Dimensionality Reduction

* Motivation: mitigate multicollinearity, noise, and curse of dimensionality.
* Techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis, (optionally) t-SNE / UMAP (for exploration).
* Interpretability vs. compression trade-offs.

## Data Exploration and Mining

* Structured EDA workflow: question → visualize → quantify → refine.
* PCA for variance structure.
* Factor Analysis for latent constructs.
* Regression Analysis for relationships and predictive structure.
* Clustering (k-means, hierarchical) for pattern discovery (if included).

## Causal Inference with Regression Analysis

* Distinguish association vs. causation.
* Model specification and confounding control.
* Assumptions: linearity, independence, homoskedasticity, exogeneity.
* Interpretation of coefficients and marginal effects.
* Sensitivity and robustness checks.
